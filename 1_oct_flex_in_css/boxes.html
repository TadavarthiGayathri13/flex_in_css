    <h2>Difference Between CSS flex box layout model and CSS Grid layout model</h2>
    <h2><u><b>CSS Flex Box model</b></u></h2>
    <p>1.Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, either in a row or a column.<br>
       2. It is suitable for laying out items along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.<br>
       3.It allows easy reordering of elements regardless of their source order in the HTML.<br>
       4.Provides powerful alignment capabilities for both the items and the container itself.<br>
       5.Aligning items vertically and horizontally is straightforward.<br>
       6.Flexbox is well-suited for building responsive and dynamic layouts,
        especially for components within a container.
    </p>
    <h2><u><b>CSS Grid Layout Box model</b></u></h2>
    <p>
        1.Grid is designed for two-dimensional layout, allowing you to define both rows and columns.
        It's ideal for creating complex, grid-based layouts.<br>
        2.You can explicitly define the size of rows and columns using various units (pixels, percentages, etc.).<br>
        3.Allows alignment of items along both the row and column axes simultaneously.<br>
        4.Grid can handle items that are placed outside the explicitly defined grid, creating implicit grid tracks.<br>
        5.Allows for the creation of complex layouts by defining named grid areas. <br>
    </p>
   <h2><u><b>When to Use Each:</b></u></h2> 
 <h3><u>Flexbox:</u></h3>
     <p>**Use for one-dimensional layouts or when dealing with a single axis (row or column) layout.
     Best for aligning items within a container or creating flexible components.</p>
<h3><u>Grid:</u></h3>
   <p> **Use for two-dimensional layouts where you need to manage both rows and columns.
    Ideal for building complex page layouts or aligning items in a precise grid structure.</p>
